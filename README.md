Create "./result" for output directory before running.

rabbit____.m is the main program. Running this code will sweep the PCL from 3000-80 ms.

This code is for Cross-Linker concentration of 10%. (CL=0.1) Adjust if needed.

yfinal_???.mat is the final data saved in ./result/ folder (??? is PCL in ms); it can be used as initial data for the next run.

Theoretical detail and code verification are shown in the PDF.
